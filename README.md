# Raspberry-Pi-Sense-Hat-Programs
A collection of scripts for the Sense Hat (ALL work on the Sense Hat Emulator, both on the Pi and on Trinket-IO website)

I have a Raspberry Pi, but Don't have a Sense Hat

When I updated my OS for the Pi to Raspbian Jessie Pixel it had a new Sense Hat Emulator, an API like virtual version that you can interact with.

So I know that you are limited like this because you can't make full use of the sensors and amazing things it is capable of, but you CAN still interact with the LED matrix and write games, and fun little programs for it.

I loved this, because you can see your code interact physically with hardware, even if it is only onscreen. So Trinket IO is one of the sites that has an Emulator online for the Sense Hat - it was the best one I tried. It means that you get a virtual image of the Sense Hat and the LED matrix, plus little sliders for the atmospheric sensors...but alongside is a code editor, and you can write code that plays with the SenseHat directly.

MOST of the codes here are a collection of things I found while trying to learn more about codeing the Sense Hat, so a lot aren't my actual work although I hae rewritten them for my own use.

ALL of the codes here will work on the Real version and the Digital or Virtual version, either online at Trinket.io or on the Raspberry Pi itself using Raspbian Jessie Pixel

Theres some cool stuff here, from little games, to interacting with the Minecraft Pi game! I am not taking credit for any of the work that's not mine, I am just putting what I have found in one place for others to find easily!

NOTE:
=======
There are one ortwo scripts here that require additional modules to be imported to Python

If you use the Online Emulator (trinket.io) then you will find that some won't run because they don't have access to the required modules.

If you run them on the Pi however they will run fine, providing you have them installed. Most I am sure are just Standard Python modules like random and itertools so you will be fine using the Pi
